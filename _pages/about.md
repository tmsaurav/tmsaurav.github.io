I graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from Temple University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 2018. In the same year, I joined the Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) program at The University of Melbourne where I worked on direct numerical simulation (DNS) of rough-wall turbulent flows using high performance computing. I completed my degree with an Outstanding H1 (First Class Honours, 91%) in 2021, and later joined the PhD program at UNSW Canberra in 2022. My current research focuses on developing numerical models to simulate ember storms in wildfires.

<em>Research interests: computational fluid dynamics, spectral element method, high performance computing, large-eddy simulation, bushfire modelling</em>
